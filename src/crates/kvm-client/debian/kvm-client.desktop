# =============================================================================
# kvm-client.desktop — Desktop Entry File for KVM-Over-IP Client
# =============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   This file tells Linux desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.) how
#   to display and launch the KVM-Over-IP Client application.
#
# WHAT IS A .DESKTOP FILE? (for beginners)
#   A .desktop file is the Linux equivalent of a Windows shortcut (.lnk file).
#   When placed in /usr/share/applications/, the desktop environment reads it
#   and shows the application in the application menu / launcher.
#
# SPECIFICATION:
#   This file follows the XDG Desktop Entry Specification:
#   https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/
#
# INSTALLATION:
#   The .deb package installs this file to:
#     /usr/share/applications/kvm-client.desktop
#   The desktop environment automatically picks it up — no restart needed.
#
# ICON:
#   The Icon= line references "kvm-client" without a path or extension.
#   The desktop environment searches standard icon theme paths for the icon.
#   Place icon files in /usr/share/icons/hicolor/<size>/apps/kvm-client.png
#   (or .svg for scalable icons).
